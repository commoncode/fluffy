fluffy
======

A collection of generic functions for fabric deploy scripts as used by most
of Tangent's projects. To make re-using these snippets across projects easier
and provide an easier way of backporting fixes into projects, these fabric
functions are now available here as a separate installable package.

More details and docs are coming...
